### Summary
This scaffolded application provides a starting point for creating Swift applications running on [Kitura](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/kitura/).

### Requirements
* [Swift 3](https://swift.org/download/)

### Project contents
This application has been generated with the following capabilities and services:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Static web file serving](#static-web-file-serving)

#### Static web file serving
This application includes a `public` directory in the root of the project. The contents of this directory will be served as static content using the built-in Kitura [StaticFileServer module](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura/wiki/Serving-Static-Content).

This content is hosted on `/`. For example, if you want to view `public/myfile.html` and the application is hosted at https://localhost:8080, go to https://localhost:8080/myfile.html.

### Configuration
Your application configuration information is stored in the `config.json` in the project root directory. This file is in the `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive information from being stored in git.

The connection information for any configured services, such as username, password and hostname, is stored in this file.

The application uses the [Configuration package](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Configuration) to read the connection and configuration information from this file.

### Run
To build and run the application:
1. `swift build`
1. `npm install --save carbon-components`
1. `gulp`
1. `.build/debug/sample`
